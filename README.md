# UberTracker

UberTracker is a UWP-based application designed to assist rideshare drivers by providing an easy-to-use interface for logging of rides and deliveries. It is designed to log trips, expenses, and vehicle statistics for use in optimizing rideshare work. Some of the initial goals include:

1. Log trips and automatically categorize them into daily, monthly, and weekly buckets for easy performance tracking
2. Maintain records of mileage and other vehicle/equipment deductions for easy use come tax time
3. Provide generous statistical charting and records for things such as:
   - Peak times and days
   - Average pay per hour
   - Highest paying/most active ZIP codes for trips
   - Provide detailed records of earnings and expenses for income tax use
   
UberTracker maintains data integrity through use of SQL Server stores. It uses UWP base components for much of the UI, with some assistance from Syncfusion Community components for things such as charting and data entry.
